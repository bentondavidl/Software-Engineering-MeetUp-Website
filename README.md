# Software-Engineering-MeetUp-Website

This website was created for ITSC 3155 with Dr. Nadia Najjar. This was a group project between David Benton, Joshua Boshers, Paul Goudreau, and Swapnil Katakwar.  
  
Environment Setup:

* Navigate into the top-level directory of this project
* `python3 -m venv venv`
* `source venv/Scripts/activate`
* `pip install -r requirements.txt`

Do not include `--upgrade` in the `pip install` command. We are using a specific version of `sqlalchemy` which means that newer versions do not work.
