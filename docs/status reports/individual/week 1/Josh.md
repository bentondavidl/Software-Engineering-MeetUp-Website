# Josh's Weekly Status Report

Week 1: 3/14-3/20

## Progress this Week

My group and I worked on brainstorming possible features, designs, and ideas about the group project. We did this by constructing new ideas as a team and discussing them. We learned that structuring which questions and feature types we focused our thoughts on, the more ideas it allowed us to come up with. Thus, allowing for a more efficient and goal-oriented brain storming session.

## Goals for Next Week


The group and I will be focusing on setting up the repository fully, getting the app framework ready to go and begin on organizing our sprints. This weekâ€™s goal is to begin setting up the HTML structure of the web site as well as getting the python features started.
