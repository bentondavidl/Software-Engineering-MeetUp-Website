Swapnil's Weekly Status Report
Week 1: 3/14-3/20

Progress: 
I have set up and cloned the git repository for this group project to my machine.
We reached out to the remaining group members yet they still have not replied. 
We got general background information for coding with each group member.

Goals for next week:
Get set up with python for the event creation. 
Get the whole group set up with the repository.
