# David's Weekly Status Report

Week 1: 3/14-3/20

## Goals from Last Week

* N/A

## Progress this Week

This week I set-up the GitHub Repo and the basic file structure for the application and created a Trello board and helped write user stories. There have been no issues so far with the basic set-up on my end, but we have yet to hear from 2 of our group mates. Figuring out user stories for all of the planned features was a little challenging at first before we got the hang of it, but it became easier with practice. We now have a justification for each of the features we want to have and a basic understanding of how we are going to get there.

## Goals for Next Week

* Get the Python working for the basic Display events feature
* Get the Python working for the basic single event display feature
* Get the Python working for the basic event creation
