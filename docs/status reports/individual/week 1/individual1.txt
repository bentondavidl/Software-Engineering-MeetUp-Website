What i learned this week was from us doing the flasks assignments. We worked on making our basics outlined for our project. We didnt get stuck yet but as we continue on we may run into a problem.

As for my goals this week i plan to help my team with whatever needs worked on. I also have to time manage what we do in our project and make sure everything is on track. We should be able to dive deeper into our project this week and get some of our agenda done.
