# David's Weekly Status Report

Week 3: 3/29-4/4

## Goals from Last Week

* Get everyone on the team to contribute to the project
* Work on the data flow diagram for the application
* Figure out why we are having so much difficulty communicating

## Progress this Week

I worked with Paul to complete the DFD and ERD during class and met with Oliver for the group check in. On Sunday evening I worked with Josh to complete the annotation of the wireframes. There was limited interaction with the rest of the group. Communicating with the rest of the group remains difficult and we have had limited success. I don't know how we will be able to get them on board to actually contribute to the project.

## Goals for Next Week

* Work with group to create scenarios
* Translate scenarios into Gerkin
* Get database working
