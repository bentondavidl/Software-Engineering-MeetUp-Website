# David's Weekly Status Report

Week 5: 4/13 - 4-18

## Goals from Last Week

* Finish database tables and relationships
* Hook database into python
* Get python into the html files

## Progress this Week

I did the vast majority of the work again this week. I finished the controller, finished the models, created the forms, fixed templates, and was the person who made everything finally work together. I have asked my team multiple times to participate and I have only ever gotten help from Paul and Josh. They are likely doing their share for a 5 person project, but I am doing the work of at least 3 people.

## Goals for Next Week

* Get iCal exports working
* Work on friends list feature
* Inevitably finish the work for everyone else
