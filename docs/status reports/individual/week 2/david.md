# David's Weekly Status Report

Week 2: 3/21-3/28

## Goals from Last Week

* Get the Python working for the basic Display events feature
* Get the Python working for the basic single event display feature
* Get the Python working for the basic event creation

## Progress this Week

Got basic python working for the first C and R pieces of CRUD. I also worked with Paul to finish all the necessary pieces of the product backlog. During this week, Paul and I were the only two people that attended classes so we were the ones that did the vast majority of the work on the project. On Thursday, we completed the wireframe process and then I put together the storyboard to link the features. The two of us also talked through the various ethical implications of an application like this. We are having a very difficult time getting the whole group to communicate which is very frustrating. Despite this, the project continues to progress at a healthy rate.

## Goals for Next Week

* Get everyone on the team to contribute to the project
* Work on the data flow diagram for the application
* Figure out why we are having so much difficulty communicating
