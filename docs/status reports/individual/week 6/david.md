# David's Weekly Status Report

Week 6: 4/19 - 4-25

## Goals from Last Week

* Get iCal exports working
* Work on friends list feature
* Inevitably finish the work for everyone else

## Progress this Week

This week we got to distribute the work for the remaining features. I took the iCal feature to do the backend for it myself. Paul and Josh took responsibility for editing most of the front end. TJ and Swap were responsible implementing the images feature and sorting. I got iCal exports working in testing on my feature specific branch. I also walked Swap and TJ through the edits they needed to make on their features.

## Goals for Next Week

* Merge all features together into main
* Work on documenting the codebase
* Help others update the DFD and ERD as well as wire frames where needed
